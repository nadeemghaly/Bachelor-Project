# Bachelor-Project
My bachelor project, in which I demonstrated an implementation in order to achieve spatial noise cancellation

## Idea 
The Main idea for this project was to come up with a design of a system that can make use of noise cnacellation such as a room. Hence the project name "Dynamic room noise cancellation". In this project two main aspects were addressed; Active Noice Cancellation, Passive noise Canellation.

## Motivation 
Being a resident of Cairo which is considered to be one of the noisiest cities. Another reason was the health hazards of being exposed to high levels of noise for a long period of time.

## EDIT
After 4 months of research, I decided to turn this project into a simulation on MatLab as the hardware implementation was quite infeasible
